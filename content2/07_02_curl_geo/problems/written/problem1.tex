\begin{problem}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the curl of the vector field $\mathbf{F} = (x,y,z)$. Explain why your answer makes sense geometrically.
\item Suppose we have a $C^1$ vector field $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = (f(x), g(y), h(z))$. Compute the curl of $\mathbf{F}$, and explain why your answer makes sense geometrically.
\end{enumerate}
