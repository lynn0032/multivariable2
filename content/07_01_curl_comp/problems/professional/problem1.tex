\begin{problem}
%Rewritten Stewart Problem, could probably be rewritten more for clarity.
Consider a wheel $W$ centered at a point on the $z$-axis, rotating about the $z$-axis. In this problem, we will investigate how the rotation of this wheel relates to the curl of a vector field describing its motion.

Let $P$ be a point on the wheel $W$, of distance $d$ from the center. The rotation of the wheel can be describe by the vector $\mathbf{w}=\omega\mathbf{k}$, where $\omega$ is the angular speed of the wheel $W$. You may assume that $\omega$ is constant. Let $\mathbf{x}(x,y,z)$ give the position of $P$ at time $t$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Carefully explain why $\mathbf{x}'(t)$ is orthogonal to both $\mathbf{w}$ and $\mathbf{x}(t)$. Then use the angle $\theta$ in the figure to show that $\mathbf{x}'(t) = \mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{x}(t)$. We can therefore define a ``velocity field $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = \mathbf{w}\times(x,y,z)$, which describes the motion of the wheel $W$. In other words, every point on $W$ has velocity given by $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z)$.
\item Show that $\mathbf{x}'(t) = (-\omega y, \omega x)$.
\item Show that $\nabla\times\mathbf{F} = 2\mathbf{w}$. Hence if the motion of an object is described by the velocity field $\mathbf{F}$, the curl vector points in the direction of the axis of (positive) rotation, and its length is proportional to the angular speed of the rotation.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{hint}
What is the linear speed of $P$ in terms of $\mathbf{x}$?

Recall that angular speed equals linear speed divided by radius. How you can write this in terms of $\omega$, $d$, and $\mathbf{x}$?

Be sure your solution addresses why $\mathbf{x}'(t)$ is $\mathbf{w}\times\mathbf{x}(t)$, and not $\mathbf{x}(t)\times\mathbf{w}$.
