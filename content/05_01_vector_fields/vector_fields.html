<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1000"></a>Motivation</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Suppose we want to look at temperature patterns across a region at some specific
time. We might represent this by taking the temperature at various locations, and
then plotting each temperature at its location on a map.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >PICTURE
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >Now, suppose we want to represent wind patterns across the same region at some
specific time. We can represent this by plotting the wind speeds at various locations,
but this doesn’t tell the whole story - we’d also like to represent the direction in
which the wind is blowing.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >In order to do this, we can instead plot a <em>vector</em> at each location. The direction of the
vector will tell us the direction of the wind, and the length of the vector will tell us
the wind speed.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >PICTURE
</p><!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Although we only plot the vectors at a few points, we know that there are windspeed
vectors that could be drawn at every point in the region. However, we can use this
plot to infer the behavior of windspeed in general, without checking the windspeed
everywhere in the region.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >This is an example of a vector field. There are many other important examples of
vector fields, and they can be used to represent fluid flow, gravitational fields, and

<h3 class="likesectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-2000"></a>Definition</h3>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >We’ve seen that a vector field consists of vectors placed at each point in some region,
and we can think of this as assigning a vector to each point in the region. This
sounds like a function, and provides the intuition behind our definition of a vector
field.
</p>
<div class="theorem-like problem-environment definition" id="problem1"><a 
 id="x1-2001r1"></a>A <em>vector field</em> is a function <script type="math/tex">\vec {F}:X\subset \mathbb {R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb {R}n</script>.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >If <script type="math/tex">\vec {F}</script> is a continuous function, then we say that <script type="math/tex">\vec {F}</script> is a <em>continuous vector field</em>.
</div>
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >In this definition, we’re thinking about the inputs as points and the outputs as
vectors, even though both are in <script type="math/tex">\mathbb {R}^n</script>.

<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >If the vectors in our vector field are particularly long, graphing our vector field can
quickly turn into a cluttered mess. In these situations, it can be useful to
scale the vectors, so that we can more clearly see the behavior of our vector
field.
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >EXAMPLE
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >In fact, most graphing software will automatically scale vector fields, whether you
want them to or not.
